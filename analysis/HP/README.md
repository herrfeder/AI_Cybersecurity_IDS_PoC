# Content
This page contains the script and the notebook to train various models.

# Notice!
* The hyperparameter optimization is inherent to each model. This must be indicated under the parameter grid also in which or in which dimensions the parameter space is to be searched here. 
* Also the models are defined far at the beginning self-evidently.
* The work here refers exclusively only to the solution of classification problems. A regression is not possible with it.
* The necessary packages are to be installed beforehand as well as the announcement of the CPUs to be used. Please pay attention to the necessary switches. (same with input data)
